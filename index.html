<p>Some stuff about ManyWho.</p>

          <h2 id="creating-your-first-flow">Creating Your First Flow</h2>

<p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a Flow on ManyWho. More specific details on what a Flow is can be found (here)[#flows],
for the purposes of this tutorial all you need to know is that a Flow is a series of steps that you have defined that users can execute through.</p>

<aside class="notice">
This tutorial assumes that you have already registered with ManyWho and that you have logged in to the Draw tool: https://flow.manywho.com/draw
</aside>

<h3 id="create-a-new-flow">Create a New flow</h3>

<ol>
<li>You can create a new Flow by selecting the <strong>Flows</strong> menu item then click the <strong>New</strong> button.</li>
<li>Decide how you will want users running your Flow to authenticate with the Flow. For example you may want to restrict access to your Flow to only users in a specific Salesforce group.
For now select <strong>ManyWho Identity</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong></li>
<li>By default new Flows will be publically accessible and won&rsquo;t display a social feed (this can be changed at any time). Click <strong>Save &amp; Open</strong> to open the Flow to edit.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="flow-editor">Flow Editor</h4>

<p><img title="Flow Editor" alt="Flow Editor" src="images/flow-editor.png" /></p>

<ol>
<li>The tab bar along the top of the Flow Editor displays the currently open Flows. You can switch between each one by clicking on the tab.</li>
<li>Return to the Admin view</li>
<li>Toolbox bar displays all the available Map Elements you can add to a Flow. Hover for more information about each Map Element. Click the chevron at the top to expand &amp; collapse the toolbox.</li>
<li>Various actions for a Flow. Hover for more information about each action.</li>
<li>Canvas that displays the Flow, drop Map Elements from the Toolbox to add them to your Flow.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="adding-a-map-element-to-your-flow">Adding a Map Element to your Flow</h3>

<p>A Flow must contain 1 or more Map Elements that will define what the Flow will do. We are going to add a Step to the Flow that will display some text. You can add a Step by dragging &amp; dropping the Step element from the toolbox bar onto the canvas.</p>

<p>After you drop the Step element onto the canvas the element configuration panel will slide in from the right of the Flow graph.</p>

<p>Give your Step a name and some content that you want it to display then hit the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-the-start-element">Connecting the Start Element</h3>

<p>For a Flow to be valid the Start Map Element must be connected to one Map Element via an (Outcome)[#outcome].</p>

<p>You can create an Outcome between Start and the new Step by dragging from the orange drag handle in the center of the Start element and dropping onto the Step. This will display the Outcome configuration panel, give your Outcome a name and label and hit the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id="running-the-flow">Running the Flow</h3>

<p>Now that you have created a Flow you can run it by clicking on the <strong>Run</strong> button in the toolbox bar, this will display the Run dialog, in here click the <strong>Run</strong> button and your Flow will open in a new tab.</p>

          <h2 id="shared-elements">Shared Elements</h2>

<h3 id="flows">Flows</h3>

<p>A Flow is an implementation of a process on the ManyWho platform. It will contain 1 or more <a href="http://google.com">Map Elements</a>
and <a href="http://google.com">Outcomes</a> that determines what happens and in what order.</p>

<h4 id="flow-urls">Flow URLs</h4>

<p>When you run a Flow a url is generated that you can use to share your Flow, for example:</p>

<p>https://flow.manywho.com/ba986a91-a39c-46db-91fd-14aa0545546f/play/default?flow-id=4003a819-e167-417f-a48e-fa7456d284d1&amp;flow-version-id=d240fd97-4c96-4cfe-9cf6-f70eac0a97c2&amp;navigation-element-id=b4d908e9-36fa-43a9-ab5f-f9af71d72fbf</p>

<p>This breaks down to:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>URL Part</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Optional</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>https://flow.manywho.com/</td>
<td>Platform</td>
<td>No</td>

<td>The Id of the navigation element to include in the Flow</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="activating-amp-versioning">Activating &amp; Versioning</h4>

<p>When you run a Flow it will include a version ID <code class="prettyprint">flow-version-id</code>. Each time you run a Flow all the elements in the Flow are &ldquo;snapshotted&rdquo; to a specific version.</p>

<p>Activating a Flow performs the same snapshotting as running a Flow however it also sets this latest version as the <strong>default</strong> version.
The default version will be run when you open a Flow via a url that doesn&rsquo;t contain a version ID e.g. https://flow.manywho.com/<tenant-id>/default/play/<flow-id></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t specify the version ID in your url then you can consider activating a Flow the same as &ldquo;Go Live&rdquo; button.</p>

<h4 id="shared-elements">Shared Elements</h4>

<p>Values, Types, Page Layouts, Services &amp; Tags are shared and can be used in multiple Flows.</p>

<p>When you activate a Flow a snapshot of the shared elements is taken, after this any changes made to the shared elements won&rsquo;t affect the activated version of the Flow.</p>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>

<p>Services allow you to interact with the world outside of your Flow. Services add a variety of functionality when added to your flow, including:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Functionality</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Database</td>
<td>Saving, Loading &amp; Deleting data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actions</td>
<td>Perform one or more operations in the 3rd party service i.e. send a text message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Authorization</td>
<td>Gate your flows using Username &amp; Password or OAuth2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Files</td>
<td>Upload &amp; Download Files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Voting</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice">
Services are implemented outside of ManyWho, available services can be found here:
More information on creating your own Service can be found here:
</aside>

<h3 id="types">Types</h3>

<p>Types allow you define the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of a complex value by defining what properties (which can be thought of sub-values) are available.</p>

<p>Types can be thought of as Interfaces if you are familiar with programming.</p>

<aside class="notice">
Types on their own don&rsquo;t do anything. To use a Type you will need to create an Object Value.
</aside>

<h3 id="values">Values</h3>

<p>Values are used to hold your data while a Flow is running e.g. load customer info from Salesforce into a Value, edit the Value in your Flow, save the Value back to Salesforce.</p>

<p>Values are split into 3 basic categories:</p>

<h4 id="primitive">Primitive</h4>

<p>Primitive Values hold simple content only, including:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>String</td>
<td>Basic Text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number</td>
<td>Digits 0-9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DateTime</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Content</td>
<td>Rich Text i.e. formatting, images, etc</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="objects">Objects</h4>

<p>Object values are values that are linked to a specific Type. When a value is an Object of a specific Type then the value will have all the properties of that Type.</p>

<h4 id="lists">Lists</h4>

<p>Lists can hold 1 or more values of a specific type e.g. String, Number, Object, etc.</p>

<aside class="notice">
Values that are created as a List are still a single Value. Although they can contain multiple &ldquo;values&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;list item1&rdquo;, &ldquo;list item2&rdquo;, &ldquo;list item3&rdquo;, it will still have a single ID and Name.
</aside>

<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3>

<h3 id="players">Players</h3>

<p>A Player is the &ldquo;renderer&rdquo; for your Flows that is used to display an executing Flow to the end user. By default Flows will be displayed using the &ldquo;default&rdquo; HTML5 Player, this will display your Flows in a browser and supports all the functionality provided by the ManyWho platform.</p>

<p>You can edit this player and / or create new HTML5 based players in ManyWho by selecting the <strong>Players</strong> menu option.</p>

<p>More information on the default HTML5 player and the UI framework in general can be found <a href="#ui-framework">here</a> </p>

          <h2 id="map-elements">Map Elements</h2>

<p>Map Elements are the individual steps in your Flow that perform various actions e.g. displaying a form, saving &amp; loading data, creating an item in Salesforce, etc.</p>

<p>You can edit an existing Map Element in your Flow by double-clicking on it in the Flow editor. The Map Element Config panel will then slide in from the right of the screen.</p>

<p>You can add a new Map Element into your Flow by dragging &amp; dropping a Map Element from the palette sidebar on the left.</p>

<h3 id="step">Step</h3>

<p><img alt="Step" src="images/step.jpg" /></p>

<p>Steps should be used when you want to display rich text content including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Formatted Text (headings, bold, italics, alignment, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Outcomes will be displayed as buttons below your content.</p>

<h3 id="page">Page</h3>

<p><img alt="Page" src="images/page.jpg" /></p>

<p>Pages will display the content of a previously created Page Layout.</p>

<p>Page Layouts allow you to define complex layouts and can contain components to accept user input.</p>

<p>In the Map Element Config panel you can select to use and existing Page Layout from the dropdown, <strong>Edit</strong> the selected Page Layout, or create a <strong>New</strong> Page Layout.
Clicking either the <strong>Edit</strong> or <strong>New</strong> buttons will open the Page Layout in the Page Layout editor tab.</p>

<h3 id="operator">Operator</h3>

<p><img alt="Operator" src="images/operator.jpg" /></p>

<p>Operators allow you to manipulate Values when your Flow is running by defining one or more operations. For example you could set a date/time Value to now, or assign an object Value&rsquo;s property.</p>

<p>You can add an operation by clicking the <strong>New</strong> button under the <strong>Operations</strong> tab. Existing operations can be edited or deleted by clicking the relevant buttons next to the relevant operation.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-an-operation">Configuring an Operation</h4>

<ul>
<li>Select a value that you want to operate on (<strong>Value</strong>)</li>
<li>Select what type of operation you want to perform (<strong>Operation</strong>)

<ul>
<li>Set Equal To</li>
<li>Empty: Remove any existing content or items</li>
<li>Create New</li>
<li>Update: Add an item to a List or update an existing item in the List</li>
<li>Remove: Remove an item from a List</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select what command to use (<strong>Command</strong>)

<ul>
<li>Value Of</li>
<li>Length Of: Use the length of a List as the value</li>
<li>First Record From: Use the first item of a List as the value</li>
<li>Last Record From: Use the last item of a List as the value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select the Value that you want to get the value from (<strong>Reference</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value: My Value</li>
<li>Operation: Set Equal To</li>
<li>Command: Value Of</li>
<li>Reference: My Other Value</li>
</ul>

<p>Can be read as &ldquo;My Value = My Other Value&rdquo; or &ldquo;Set My Value to be equal to My Other Value&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="ordering">Ordering</h4>

<p>Each operation can be given a specific Order value (from 0 to infinity). This number will determine the order in which the operations will be run. Operations with the same order will be execute simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="decision">Decision</h3>

<p><img alt="Decision" src="images/decision.jpg" /></p>

<p>Decisions allow you to execute an outcome based of one or more conditions in your flow.</p>

<h3 id="message">Message</h3>

<p><img alt="Message" src="images/message.jpg" /></p>

<p>Messages allow you to interact with systems outside of ManyWho via Services (more information on services can be found here: ). For example sending a text message using the Twilio service.</p>

<p>You can define one or more Actions on a single Message Element. You can add an Action by clicking the New button under the General tab. Existing Actions can be edited or deleted by clicking the relevant buttons next to the relevant operation.</p>

<h4 id="anatomy-of-a-message-action">Anatomy of a Message Action</h4>

<h5 id="inputs">Inputs</h5>

<p>A Message Action can define zero or more inputs that may or may not be required. Each Input will have a name and a type (String, Number, etc).</p>

<p>For example the &ldquo;Send Text Message&rdquo; Action in the Twilio Service has three Inputs: To, From &amp; Message.</p>

<h4 id="outputs">Outputs</h4>

<p>A Message Action can define zero or more outputs. Like Inputs each Output will have a name and a type.</p>

<p>For example the &ldquo;Send Text Message&rdquo; Action in Twilio Service has one Output: Reply</p>

<h4 id="configuring-an-action">Configuring an Action</h4>

<ul>
<li>Select the Service that contains the Action that you want to execute</li>
<li>Select the Action that you want to execute</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Give your Action a name</li>
<li>For each Input for this Action select a Value to use as the Input (for non-required Inputs this is optional)</li>
<li>For each Output for this Action select a Value that will hold the value returned by the service (this is optional)</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ordering">Ordering</h4>

<p>Each Action can be given a specific Order value (from 0 to infinity). This number will determine the order in which the Actions will be run. Actions with the same order will be grouped together and executed simultaneously.</p>

<p>For example if you four Actions, two with an order of 1 and two with an order of 2, the Actions with order 1 will execute first simultaneously. After they have both completed the other two Actions with an order of 2 will then execute simultaneously</p>

<h3 id="load">Load</h3>

<p>Loads allow you to fetch data from an external source via a Service into a value (either a single item or a list of items). More information on Saving, Loading &amp; Deleting can be found here:</p>

<h3 id="save">Save</h3>

<p>Saves allow you to send data back to an external source via a Service. More information on Saving, Loading &amp; Deleting can be found here:</p>

<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>

<p>Deletes allow you to delete an item or multiple items from an external source via a Service. More information on Saving, Loading &amp; Deleting can be found here:</p>

<h3 id="swimlane">Swimlane</h3>

<p>Swimlanes allow you to partition a section of your flow to use different authentication. For example you put a section of a flow into a Swimlane that only users in the Managers group have permissions to view. Users who aren&rsquo;t authorized to enter the Swimlane will see a message.</p>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>

<p>Outcomes are the lines that connect the map elements together in your Flow and define the execution path through your Flow.</p>

<p>You can create an Outcome in your Flow by dragging and dropping from the source map element to the target map element (via the orange circular handle in the center of the source map element). A single map element can have any number of Outcomes going to and from it.</p>

<aside class="notice">
A Flow won&rsquo;t be valid and will fail to run until you connect the Start element to another map element in your flow
</aside>

<p>Step &amp; Page Layout elements will display Outcomes as buttons that users running your Flow can click to determine which Outcome will be followed.</p>

          <h2 id="states">States</h2>

<p><strong>States</strong> are running instances of a flow. They contain a lot of useful data, like all the values and the current step that a user is on.</p>

<h4 id="lifetime">Lifetime</h4>

<p>States are persisted in the platform in two ways - ephemerally and permanently, depending on your requirements.</p>

<h5 id="ephemeral-states">Ephemeral States</h5>

<aside class="success">Recommended for use in <strong>Development, Testing & Staging</strong></aside>

<aside class="notice">Created when using <strong>Run</strong> in the Draw Tool</aside>

<p>Ephemeral states are states that are stored in our cache, but have no guarantees on their lifetime. They will only be available to join or use until our cache cluster needs to reclaim space for newer states, which could be at any time.</p>

<p>This type of state is fine for using while you are building or testing flows, as they&rsquo;re only short-term and will be automatically cleaned up.</p>

<h5 id="permanent-states">Permanent States</h5>

<aside class="success">Recommended for use in <strong>Production</strong></aside>

<aside class="notice">Created when using <strong>Publish</strong> in the Draw Tool</aside>

<p>Permanent states are states that are saved in our database for longer-term storage. While the state is still in progress and hasn&rsquo;t reached it&rsquo;s final step, it will be available for joining. Once a state has reached it&rsquo;s final step, it is considered &ldquo;done&rdquo; and the state will then be deleted after 3 days.</p>

<h4 id="expiration">Expiration</h4>

<p>States can be set to expire, either in the Draw Tool or the Build Tool. After a state expires, anyone who tries to join or progress through it will receive the message <em>&ldquo;The state with ID 12345 has now expired&rdquo;</em> and will no longer be able to interact with or view it.</p>

<h5 id="setting-an-expiration">Setting an Expiration</h5>

<p>When creating a new flow or editing an existing one, you can set the <strong>Expire After</strong> field to the number of seconds that the state should last for.</p>

<h2 id="ui-framework">UI Framework</h2>

<p>The ManyWho HTML5 UI framework will handle all the user interaction and rendering of Flows in a browser. The framework
is built upon some standard front end technologies including:</p>

<h4 id="id-parentid-amp-flowkey">Id, ParentId &amp; FlowKey</h4>

<p>To ensure that each component can address it&rsquo;s model it is important to pass <strong>this.props.id</strong> into <strong>component.getChildComponents</strong> at this point the UI framework will take care of setting <strong>this.props.id</strong> to the relevant id.</p>

<p><strong>this.props.flowKey</strong> is used to identify the flow that this component belongs too, this exists to support running multiple flows on the same page simultaneously. You won&rsquo;t need to do administer flowKey however it is important that it is passed into the relevant functions (e.g. getContainer, getClasses, getChildren, getChildComponents, etc).</p>

<h4 id="render-required">render (required)</h4>

<ul>
<li>model.GetContainer: returns the model object for the container that was fetched from ManyWho</li>
<li>styling.getClasses: returns classes that may have been defined by the parent container that should be applied to this container / component</li>
<li>model.getChildren: returns the child model objects for this container</li>
<li>component.getChildComponents: returns the React components for the various child containers / components for this container</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="manywho-component-register-required">manywho.component.Register (required)</h4>

<p>Register the component with the framework, this will ensure that you&rsquo;re component will be rendered.</p>

<h4 id="manywho-styling-registercontainer-optional">manywho.styling.registerContainer (optional)</h4>

<p>Register styling information that should be applied to any child components when they are being rendered. This should return either an empty array or an array of class names.
<strong>item</strong> will be the model of the child being rendered and <strong>container</strong> will be the model of the container that contains <strong>item</strong>. An example of this being used can be found
here: https://github.com/manywho/ManyWho_HTML5_Players2/blob/master/runtime/js/components/horizontal.js#L54</p>

          <h3 id="component-state-local-state-and-remote-state">Component State, Local State and Remote State</h3>

<p>When working with custom components there are 3 types of state that you should be aware of:</p>

<h4 id="component-state">Component State</h4>

<p>This is the regular React component state which can be accessed by this.state. Documentation about React component state can be found here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html</p>

<h4 id="local-state">Local State</h4>

<p>This is the ManyWho flow state that currently exists in your browser session. The flow state contains a snapshot of the current state (values, selections, etc) of the flow.</p>
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">manywho</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">state</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getComponent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">flowKey</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

<h4 id="remote-state">Remote State</h4>

<p>This is the same as the local state however it exists in the ManyWho cloud. The only important distinction is that the local state may be &ldquo;out of sync&rdquo; with the remote state periodically i.e. a user running a flow enters some values into some inputs on a page, these values only exist in the local state until the UI informs ManyWho to sync (usually via an outcome on the page).</p>

<h4 id="which-state-should-i-use-in-my-components">Which state should I use in my components?</h4>

<p>Component state should be used when you need to track changes that only affect the UI and don&rsquo;t need to be synced to the flow e.g. dropdown toggling, switching between tabs.</p>

<p>Local State should be used when you do care about syncing changes back to ManyWho e.g. values entered into an input. Generally when rendering a component you will want to check if the state has a value to be displayed then fallback to the model to get a value, then in the components event handler call manywho.state.setComponent to put the updated value into the local state.</p>

<p>Remote state is taken care of for you, if you want your component to trigger events in the flow e.g. this combobox should sync with the remote state when the value changes as other components will update based on the selected value in the combobox, then you should call manywho.component.handleEvent in your components change handler(s).</p>

          <h3 id="debugging-the-html5-player-locally">Debugging the HTML5 Player Locally</h3>

<p>When creating custom components you may need to debug the existing HTML5 player code in its un-compiled format:</p>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Clone the HTML5 PLayers2 repo: https://github.com/manywho/ManyWho_HTML5_Players2</li>
<li>open <code class="prettyprint">runtime\default.html</code> and edit <code class="prettyprint">manywho.settings.initialize</code></li>
<li>Open a the command line, cd into the repro directory and run gulp refresh</li>
<li>You can debug a production flow by adding the tenant-id, flow-id &amp; flow-version-id query parameters in the browser (join query parameter is also supported) e.g. <code class="prettyprint">http://localhost:3000?tenant-id=mytenantid&amp;flow-id=myflowid&amp;flow-version-id=myflowversionid</code></li>
</ol>

          <h1 id="connect">Connect</h1>

<p>This section contains information on how you can connect/integrate ManyWho to various other applications and platforms. Typically there are two parts to any integration:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Service</strong>: Links ManyWho to the underlying database, identity management system, file store, logic, social networking, code, etc of the underlying platform.</li>
<li><strong>UI</strong>: Embedding the ManyWho user experience directly into the application/platform. In some cases, the connected/integrated platform may provide additional UI components or may offer UI itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>This section is broken down into each supported application/platform.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-service">Building a Service</h2>

<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>

<ul>
<li>Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is recommended, for integration with Jersey)</li>
<li>Maven 3</li>
<li>JDK 8 or higher</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="creating-a-project">Creating a Project</h4>

<p>There is a Maven archetype available that will create a basic Service, along with some example actions, types and controller endpoints. Follow these instructions to install it inside IntelliJ:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new project of type <strong>Maven</strong>, ticking the <strong>Create from archetype</strong> box, then clicking the <strong>Add archetype</strong> button and supplying the following details:

<ul>
<li><strong>GroupId</strong>: com.manywho.services</li>
<li><strong>ArtifactId</strong>: example-archetype</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong>: 1.4.0</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On the next screen, give your service a relevant group ID and artifact ID that follows the standard Java convention, e.g. com.manywho.services.github (replacing your TLD, company name and the name of your service)</p></li>
<li><p>IntelliJ will now be running the Maven goal to create the project from the archetype. When it finishes, click Enable auto-import on the popup at the top right and you should be good to go!</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="adding-the-grizzly-configuration">Adding the Grizzly Configuration</h4>

<p>Using the Grizzly server to run the service locally is the best option, as it&rsquo;s pretty easy to debug inside IntelliJ. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to set up, following these instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Run</strong> menu, choose <strong>Edit Configurations</strong></li>
<li>Click the + button at the top left, choose <strong>Application</strong>, and give it the name <em>Run</em></li>
<li>Under <strong>Configuration &gt; Main class</strong>, point to your service&rsquo;s <strong>Application</strong> class</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, and your service should now run under Grizzly when you launch it by clicking the <strong>Debug</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-build-a-service">How to: Build a Service</h3>

<p>In this tutorial, we will be building a service that integrates with GitHub. We&rsquo;ll start right from generating the basic project template, and finish off with a service that loads, saves, and hits actions on the GitHub API.</p>

<p>The tutorial will assume you are using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition, and have Maven 3 and JDK 8 or higher installed.</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-service-base">Creating the Service Base</h4>

<p>Follow the instruction on the Building a Service page to get the base structure of your service set up.</p>

<h4 id="building-the-describe-response">Building the Describe Response</h4>

<p>Every service needs to return a Describe response from its /metadata endpoint. This response tells ManyWho what the service supports (i.e. Database, Identity, Logic, Files and Social). The Java SDK provides a simple builder class so it&rsquo;s super easy to create a describe response.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up <strong>DescribeController</strong> from inside the <strong>controllers</strong> package</li>
<li>Our GitHub service will provide the following:

<ul>
<li>Database (for loading a list of user repositories)</li>
<li>Identity (for logging into a Flow using GitHub)</li>
<li>Logic (for forking a repository)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a call to <code class="prettyprint">setProvidesIdentity(true)</code> inside the <code class="prettyprint">describe()</code> method, so it looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="highlight java"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">DescribeServiceResponse</span> <span class="nf">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ServiceRequest</span> <span class="n">serviceRequest</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DescribeServiceBuilder</span><span class="o">()</span>

            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setProvidesIdentity</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">)</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setProvidesLogic</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">)</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setCulture</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Culture</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"EN"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"US"</span><span class="o">))</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createDescribeService</span><span class="o">()</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createResponse</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>

<h4 id="create-a-github-application">Create a GitHub Application</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll need an application on GitHub so that we can authorize users through OAuth2 and make calls on their behalf. You can create a new application on GitHub for free <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications/new">here</a>, and make sure the <strong>Callback URL</strong> is https://flow.manywho.com/api/run/1/oauth2. Make a note of the generated <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>, as we&rsquo;ll need them later.</p>

<h3 id="adding-authentication-identity">Adding Authentication (Identity)</h3>

<p>As the GitHub API is built around authorizing calls using OAuth2, we&rsquo;ll integrate an identity provider into our service that ManyWho can use to log into a Flow, which means that we can make calls on behalf of the logged in user without having to store tokens anywhere or ask them for their password.</p>

<h5 id="creating-the-oauth2-provider">Creating the OAuth2 Provider</h5>

<p>Each service that integrates with OAuth2 for authorization needs to have a Provider class, that gives the SDK&rsquo;s OAuth2 library the correct secrets and where to request tokens.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new package inside <strong>com.manywho.services.github</strong> called <strong>oauth2</strong></li>
<li>Inside this new package, create a class called <strong>GitHubProvider</strong></li>
<li>Make the new class extend <strong>AbstractOauth2Provider</strong>, which is a base class in the SDK for creating a provider in services that implement OAuth2</li>
<li>Press <strong>Ctrl+I</strong> then <strong>Enter</strong> to implement the required methods from the interface</li>
<li>Fill in the details based on this example:</li>

<p>Basically, in the code we just pasted, the <code class="prettyprint">authenticateWithGitHub()</code> method will be called from inside the <strong>AuthController</strong> (which we&rsquo;ll create in a minute), it calls out to the GitHub API to fetch the logged in user (using the GitHub Java library) and it returns an AuthenticatedWhoResult object that contains all of the logged-in user&rsquo;s information ready to be used inside a Flow.</p>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll need to add the <strong>AuthService</strong> into the application binder, so that it can be injected into other classes by Jersey:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up <strong>ApplicationBinder</strong> in the root of the main package (<strong>com.manywho.services.github</strong>)</li>
<li>Inside the <strong>configure()</strong> method, add a new line that binds any calls to <strong>AuthService</strong> to an instance of <strong>AuthService</strong>, like so</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Create a new class in the <strong>controllers</strong> package called <strong>AuthController</strong></li>
<li>Make the new class extend <strong>AbstractOauth2Controller</strong>, which is a base controller class in the ManyWho SDK for services that wish to implement authorization using OAuth2</li>
<li>Press <strong>Ctrl+I</strong> then <strong>Enter</strong> to implement the required <code class="prettyprint">authentication()</code> method</li>
<li>Press <strong>Alt+Insert</strong> then click <strong>Constructor</strong> to implement the required constructor that inherits from the <strong>AbstractOauth2Controller</strong> class</li>
<li>Now add a new field of type <strong>AuthService</strong> called <strong>authService</strong>, and annotate it with the <strong>@Inject</strong> annotation (so Jersey will automatically supply an instance into the class at runtime)</li>
<li>Finally, add a new method called <strong>authentication</strong> that returns an <strong>AuthenticatedWhoResult</strong>, and takes a single <strong>AuthenticationCredentials</strong> parameter</li>
<li>Inside this method, return the result of a call to <code class="prettyprint">authService.authenticateWithGitHub(oauth2Provider, getOauthService(), authenticationCredentials);</code></li>

<h3 id="creating-the-describe">Creating the Describe</h3>

<p>Every service is required to implement describe functionality. The /metdata endpoint of a service informs ManyWho on the capabilities of the service along with anything the service provides (e.g. Types), the describe response can implement several properties:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>ProvidesDatabase</td>
<td>Set to true if the service supports loading &amp; saving via requests sent from Load &amp; Save elements in a flow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ProvidesIdentity</td>
<td>Set to true if the service can be used as an identity provider for a flow i.e. allows a user to login using a 3rd party service like Google or Facebook</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ProvidesLogic</td>
<td>Set to true if the service supports actions that can be executed via Message elements in a flow, listening to items, providing notifications to a flow, or voting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ProvidesFiles</td>
<td>Set to true if the service supports file management</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h5 id="install">Install</h5>

<p>The service describe response also has an Install property that allows you to provide custom Types back to ManyWho that are specific to your service e.g. the JIRA service provides an <strong>Issue Type</strong> that has various properties such as Name, Type, Assignee, etc.
By default any classes in your service that extend AbstractType (from the Java SDK) will be automatically included in the describe response. You can manually add Types to the describe response install in case you need to provide dynamically generated Types as install time.</p>

<h3 id="creating-an-action">Creating an Action</h3>

<p>An action is a method that interacts with a Service that performs a task, like &ldquo;Send an Email&rdquo; or &ldquo;Assign a Task to this user&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Actions created using the Java SDK all extend the <strong>AbstractAction</strong> class and are automatically included in the Describe response when the Service installed in ManyWho. They can be added into a Service by creating a class like this:</p>

<p><strong>Action Template</strong>
&ldquo;`java
package com.manywho.services.actions;</p>

<p>import com.manywho.sdk.entities.describe.DescribeValue;
import com.manywho.sdk.entities.describe.DescribeValueCollection;
import com.manywho.sdk.enums.ContentType;
import com.manywho.sdk.services.describe.actions.AbstractAction;</p>

<p>public class Example extends AbstractAction {
    @Override
    public String getUriPart() {
        return &quot;category/name&rdquo;;
    }</p>

<p>@Override

            add(new DescribeValue(&ldquo;Example Object&rdquo;, ContentType.Object, true, null, ExampleOne.NAME));
        }};
    }</p>

<p>@Override
    public DescribeValueCollection getServiceOutputs() {
        return new DescribeValueCollection() {{
            add(new DescribeValue(&ldquo;Created?&rdquo;, ContentType.Boolean, true));
        }};

<h4 id="implementing-the-endpoint">Implementing the Endpoint</h4>

<p>As building a Service using the Java SDK uses the JAX-RS standard for building REST APIs, it&rsquo;s super easy to add an endpoint for an action - all you need is a method in a controller that has the correct annotations.</p>

<p>Say we want to add an endpoint for the example action above, we will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A controller for the action&rsquo;s &ldquo;category&rdquo; (e.g. TasksController)</li>
<li>A method in that controller for the action (e.g. assignTask)

<ul>
<li>It must be annotated with the @Path, @POST, @Consumes(&ldquo;application/json&rdquo;) and @Produces(&ldquo;application/json&rdquo;) annotations</li>
<li>It must take a <strong>ServiceRequest</strong> object as the first parameter</li>
<li>It must return a <strong>ServiceResponse</strong> object</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A way of interacting with the API (Services are a nice way of keeping code SOLID)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example Endpoint</strong>
&ldquo;`java
package com.manywho.services.controllers;</p>

<p>import com.manywho.sdk.entities.run.elements.config.ServiceRequest;
import com.manywho.sdk.entities.run.elements.config.ServiceResponse;
import com.manywho.sdk.enums.InvokeType;
import com.manywho.sdk.services.controllers.AbstractController;
import com.manywho.services.services.TaskService;</p>

<p>import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;</p>

<p>@Path(&rdquo;/tasks&quot;)
@Consumes(&ldquo;application/json&rdquo;)
@Produces(&ldquo;application/json&rdquo;)
public class ExampleController extends AbstractController {</p>

<p>@Inject
    private TaskService taskService;</p>

<p>@Path(&ldquo;/assign&rdquo;)
    @POST
    public ServiceResponse assignTask(ServiceRequest serviceRequest) throws Exception {
        this.taskService.assignTask(serviceRequest);</p>

<p>return new ServiceResponse(InvokeType.Forward, serviceRequest.getToken());
    }
}
&ldquo;`</p>

<aside class="notice">
<b>Note</b><br/>

<h3 id="creating-a-type">Creating a Type</h3>

<p>Types created the Java SDK all extend the <strong>AbstractType</strong> class and are automatically included in the Describe response when the service is installed in ManyWho. A basic Type be added into a Service by creating a class like this:</p>

<p><strong>Example Type</strong>
&rdquo;`java
package com.manywho.services.types;</p>

<p>import com.manywho.sdk.entities.draw.elements.type.TypeElementProperty;
import com.manywho.sdk.entities.draw.elements.type.TypeElementPropertyCollection;

import com.manywho.sdk.services.describe.types.AbstractType;</p>

<p>public class ExampleOne extends AbstractType {
    public final static String NAME = &ldquo;Example Type&rdquo;;</p>

<p>@Override
    public String getDeveloperName() {
        return NAME;
    }</p>

<p>@Override
    public TypeElementPropertyCollection getProperties() {
        return new TypeElementPropertyCollection() {{
            add(new TypeElementProperty(&ldquo;Property One&rdquo;, ContentType.String));
            add(new TypeElementProperty(&ldquo;Example Two&rdquo;, ContentType.Object, ExampleTwo.NAME));

<h3 id="debugging-a-service">Debugging a Service</h3>

<p>Debugging a service locally against the ManyWho platform running in the cloud is extremely useful as you won&rsquo;t have to deploy your service to use it. You can do this by using <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> which creates a tunnel between your local machine and the internet. After setting up ngrok you can debug your service by installing it into your ManyWho tenant using the ngrok url.</p>

<h3 id="errors-amp-exceptions">Errors &amp; Exceptions</h3>

<p>The ManyWho Java SDK provides 2 exception types that you should throw if an error occurs: <strong>ServiceProblemException</strong> and <strong>ApiProblemException</strong>.</p>

<aside class="notice">
<b>Note</b><br/>
&quot;Regular&rdquo; exception types such as Argument, ArgumentNull, etc will be automatically transformed into ServiceProblemExceptions and returned to ManyWho as an &ldquo;error&rdquo; response.
</aside>

<h4 id="serviceproblemexception">ServiceProblemException</h4>

<p>This exception can be avoided as the SDK will handle it, however if you need to throw a ServiceProblemException is should be used for when something goes wrong in your service. For example if an incorrect configuration value was sent to the service, or if an invalid filter was sent to the load endpoint.</p>

<h4 id="apiproblemexception">ApiProblemException</h4>

<p>This exception should be thrown when a 3rd party API that your service connects to either fails or returns an error. For example JIRA API returns an error when your service attempts to create a new issue, the error message from JIRA should be passed to the ApiProblemException along with any other relevant details i.e. response body, response headers, etc</p>

<aside class="notice">
<b>Note</b><br/>
The **message** value of the exception is what will be seen by users running the flow. The other properties will be available in the UI debugger.
</aside>

<h3 id="deploying-to-heroku">Deploying to Heroku</h3>

<p>If you created a service from the example archetype (1.4.0 upwards), then your service has built-in support for deploying to, and running on Heroku! An example Procfile is included in the root of your service, so a simple &ldquo;git push heroku master&rdquo; should get you up and running.</p>

<p>If your service isn&rsquo;t built using the example archetype then simply adding the following Procfile should work:</p>

<p><strong>Procfile</strong>
<code class="prettyprint">bash
web: java -Dserver.port=${PORT:-8080} ${JAVA_OPTS} -jar target/artifact-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

<h3 id="launching-a-flow-from-a-workflow-rule">Launching a Flow from a Workflow Rule</h3>

<p>Using Salesforce Workflow Rules, you can easily kick off a ManyWho Flow. The Flow can involve users, execute business rules and/or run over a period of time. There are no limitations on the kinds of things your Flow can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create/update multiple related or unrelated records</li>
<li>Send out emails and tasks to users</li>
<li>Request for approvals</li>
<li>Update other systems or databases</li>
<li>Send a text message notification</li>
<li>And the list goes on&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>You decide what your Flow should do. Use Workflow Rules to kick things off.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing specific about a Flow that can be launched using Workflow Rules, however, you should be aware of a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the flow uses authentication from another Service, the Workflow Rule will not be able to authenticate without coding an authentication mechanism</li>
<li>If the user triggering the Flow is not authorized, the Workflow Rule will not be able to execute the flow (though it can initialize it ready for another user to join) without coding a solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure your flow also contains two Values:</p>

<li>Click on <strong>Create -&gt; Workflow &amp; Approvals -&gt; Workflow Rules</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New Rule</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the Object you want to have trigger your Flow and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for <strong>Rule Name</strong>.</li>
<li>Select any <em>Evaluation Criteria</em> and create a <em>Rule Criteria</em> (if you don&rsquo;t need any rules, we suggest creating a <em>Rule Criteria</em> that will always be true: e.g. Lead: First Name not equal to <empty box>).</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save &amp; Next</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Add Workflow Action</strong> menu and select <strong>New Outbound Message</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for <strong>Name</strong> and the <strong>Unique Name</strong> should auto populate.</li>
<li>Configure the <strong>Endpoint URL</strong> using the documentation below this list (i.e. https://salesforce.manywho.com/plugins/api/salesforce/1/workflowrules/{tenantid}/{flowid}/{playername}).</li>
<li>For the <strong>User to send</strong> as, make sure you select a user that can authenticate correctly with your Flow (i.e. the user is able to launch the Flow if they ran it directly).</li>
<li>Tick the <strong>Send Session ID</strong> check box so the Flow can login correctly as that user.</li>
<li>In the <em>&hellip; fields to send</em> section, make sure the <em>Id</em> field is in the list of <strong>Selected Fields</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the <em>Workflow Rules Using This Outbound Message</em> section, click on the <em>Rule Name</em> of the Workflow Rule you just created.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Activate</strong> button to make this Workflow rule live for us.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case you have not added the Salesforce Service to your security settings (this only needs to be done once for your Salesforce org):</p>

<ol>
<li>In the setup tree, find the <em>Administer</em> section.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Security Controls -&gt; Remote Site Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New Remote Site</strong> button.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for <strong>Remote Site Name</strong>.</li>

<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. When a user creates or updates an Object in Salesforce, this Workflow Rule will send a request to ManyWho to start your Flow.</p>

<h4 id="endpoint-url-configuration">Endpoint URL Configuration</h4>

<p>You can configure the Endpoint URL for the Workflow Rule in various ways depending on the activity you&rsquo;re doing:</p>

</code></p>

<h3 id="listening-to-record-updates">Listening to Record updates</h3>

<p>As part of an executing Flow, it can sometimes be useful to wait for a particular record to be updated. In addition, there can be rules to determine when to proceed in the Flow. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a Task and wait for the Status to be <em>Completed</em></li>
<li>Load an existing Opportunity and wait for the Status to be <em>Closed Won</em></li>
<li>And the list goes on&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>This can also be needed at any point in your Flow - not just the start. Equally, you may need to listen to different records depending on the route the Flow executes.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-your-flow">Configuring your Flow</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing specific about a Flow that can listen to Salesforce records. Listening can happen at any point, however, Listening is only supported in the following Elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Database Load</strong>: Load a record from Salesforce and listen to any changes to it.</li>
<li><strong>Database Save</strong>: Save a new or updated record to Salesforce and listen to any further changes to it.</li>
<li><strong>Message</strong>: Based on a previously loaded record from Salesforce, listen to any changes to it.</li>
<li><strong>Page</strong>: Based on a previously loaded record from Salesforce, listen to any changes to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that you can only listen to records at the point to register the &ldquo;listener&rdquo;. Once the Flow proceeds to the next step, it is no longer listening to any further updates.</p>

<p>To add a listener to one of the above elements, you need to add the following JSON to the Map Element:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>"listeners": [
    {
      "developerName": "Hello",
      "serviceElementId": "18211a13-71b9-4e21-8d32-299027f5ab13",
      "listenerType": "EDIT",
      "valueElementToReferenceForListeningId": {
        "id": "028493b1-cb65-4724-8094-5e0997f4e6e1",
      },
      "attributes": null
    }
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Where the properties are as follows:</p>

<table><thead>

<tr>
<td>developerName</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>A memorable name for this listener so you can identify it easily in your Flow model.</td>

<td>Currently the Salesforce Service only supports EDIT. However, in future more listeners may be supported. EDIT encompasses CREATE also.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>String: GUID</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the object Value loaded from Salesforce. In order for the listener to work, you must have first populated an object Value from Salesforce. You can then use this at any time to listen to that object. You can get the list of Values in your tenant by querying the Value API (api/draw/1/element/value?filter=substringof(developername, &#39;the name of my value&rsquo;) and locating the &ldquo;id&rdquo; property of the appropriate Value.</td>

<h4 id="configuring-your-workflow-rule">Configuring your Workflow Rule</h4>

<p>In order to make a listener work, the Salesforce Service does not &ldquo;ping&rdquo; your Salesforce API for changes, but rather it relies on Workflow Rules to notify ManyWho of any record changes in the system. This approach minimizes the impact of this functionality on your API usage and also gives you greater control over the configuration of the rules. Here&rsquo;s how you configure Workflow Rules to send listener notifications:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to Salesforce (https://login.salesforce.com).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Setup</strong> and find the <em>Build</em> section in the setup tree.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Create -&gt; Workflow &amp; Approvals -&gt; Workflow Rules</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New Rule</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the Object you want to have your Flows listen to and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button. You only need to configure one listener per Object, you don&rsquo;t need to configure a Workflow Rule for each Flow that needs to listen to records of this Object type (e.g. Lead).</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for <strong>Rule Name</strong>.</li>
<li>Select any <em>Evaluation Criteri*a and create a *Rule Criteria</em> (if you don&rsquo;t want Salesforce handling the listening rules, we suggest creating a <em>Rule Criteria</em> that will always be true: e.g. Lead: First Name not equal to <empty box>). You can also create the listening rules in ManyWho.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save &amp; Next</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Add Workflow Action</strong> menu and select <strong>New Outbound Message</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for <strong>Name</strong> and the <strong>Unique Name</strong> should auto populate.</li>
<li>Configure the <strong>Endpoint URL</strong> using the documentation below this list (i.e. https://salesforce.manywho.com/plugins/api/salesforce/1/workflowrules/listener/{tenantid}).</li>
<li>For the <strong>User to send as</strong>, make sure you select a user that can authenticate correctly with your Flow.</li>
<li>Tick the <strong>Send Session ID</strong> check box so the Flow can login correctly as that user.</li>
<li>In the <em>&hellip; fields to send</em> section, make sure the Id field is in the list of <strong>Selected Fields</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the <em>Workflow Rules Using This Outbound Message</em> section, click on the <em>Rule Name of the Workflow Rule</em> you just created.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Activate</strong> button to make this Workflow rule live for us.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case you have not added the Salesforce Service to your security settings (this only needs to be done once for your Salesforce org):</p>

<ol>
<li>In the setup tree, find the <em>Administer</em> section.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Security Controls -&gt; Remote Site Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New Remote Site</strong> button.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for <strong>Remote Site Name</strong>.</li>
<li>For the <strong>Remote Site URL</strong>, provide: https://salesforce.manywho.com (or perhaps another location if you&rsquo;re using your own implementation of this Service code).</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. When a user updates an Object in Salesforce, this Workflow Rule send a notification to ManyWho and any Flows listening to the record will execute accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="endpoint-url-configuration">Endpoint URL Configuration</h4>

<p>You can configure the Endpoint URL for the Workflow Rule in various ways depending on the activity you&rsquo;re doing:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>POST plugins/api/salesforce/1/workflowrules/listener/{tenantid}

</code></p>

<h3 id="executing-soql-queries">Executing SOQL Queries</h3>

<p>Sometimes when creating a Flow, it can be useful to execute SOQL queries against Salesforce to get exactly the data you need. Though ManyWho does allow you to construct queries using the standard tooling, we don&rsquo;t support more complex queries - for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grouping and aggregate functions</li>
<li>Complex AND/OR where clauses (often where you need lots of brackets to get the logic right)</li>
<li>Queries that are just easier to understand in code</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;d obviously recommend you use the standard metadata approach as much as possible as it reduces hard coded dependencies.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-your-flow">Configuring your Flow</h4>

<p>SOQL queries are supported in the following Elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Database Load</strong>: Add complex queries to your standard database load operations</li>
<li><strong>Page</strong>: Add additional query support to your Table and Combobox lookups</li>
</ul>

<p>Wherever you have an <strong>ObjectDataRequest</strong> object in your flow, you can add complex SOQL queries. To add SOQL support to your <strong>ObjectDataRequest</strong>, you need to use the <strong>Command</strong> property:</p>
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">"objectDataRequest"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

It&rsquo;s also recommended when creating SOQL queries that you test them using the Salesforce developer tools to make sure they are correctly formatted.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="advanced-concepts-aggregate-functions">Advanced Concepts: Aggregate Functions</h4>

<p>If you are creating a SOQL query because you need to get aggregate information (e.g. a record count of grouped records, a maximum number of records, etc.) you need to create a Type for that aggregate result. We&rsquo;ll walk through an example to illustrate how that can be done here.</p>

<h5 id="construct-the-soql">Construct the SOQL</h5>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we want to get a summary list of aircraft that are available for leasing over the next year. We want to group the results by Model of aircraft and return that list with the count of how many we have in stock currently for lease. Here&rsquo;s the SOQL for that query:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>SELECT Max(Model_Replica__c), Max(Asset_Type__c), Max(Name), Count(Id), Max(Asset_Image_View__c) FROM Asset__c WHERE (Availability_Date__c = NEXT_N_DAYS:365 OR Availability_Date__c &lt;= TODAY) AND Asset_Type__c = 'Aircraft' GROUP BY Model__c
</code></pre>

<p>You can see in the query that we&rsquo;re using a number of aggregate functions and we&rsquo;re grouping by Model as expected. We now need to create a Type in ManyWho that will be used to map the result of this query to Values in our Flow. The Type defines the structure of our business objects as well as the mapping between the underlying database. As a result, we need to create a business object Type to represent this summary.</p>

<h5 id="create-the-type">Create the Type</h5>

<p>Looking at the above Query, we should create a Type for the associated fields/properties. We can do that in the Draw tool very simply:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Type called &ldquo;Model Summary&rdquo;</li>
<li>Create the following fields/properties for that Type based on the above query:

<ul>
<li>Model Replica (String)</li>
<li>Asset Type (String)</li>
<li>Name (String)</li>
<li>Count (Number)</li>
<li>Image (String) </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save the Type.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="create-the-type-binding">Create the Type Binding</h5>

<p>Now we need to create the Binding. We&rsquo;ll need to do that manually through the Build tooling.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find your newly created Type using: api/draw/1/element/type?filter=substringof(developerName, &#39;Model Summary&rsquo;).</li>
<li>Find the &ldquo;id&rdquo; property for the Type and the use: api/draw/1/element/type/<id value> to load the full Type definition.</li>
<li>Copy the contents of the right pane into the left pane - we&rsquo;re going to edit the Type definition.</li>
<li>Find the section in the document for &ldquo;bindings&rdquo;. This should be null currently.</li>
</ol>

<p>You now need to create a binding for Salesforce with field bindings from your SOQL query. This will tell ManyWho how to get the data from the your SOQL query into your Flow.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find your Salesforce Service using: api/draw/1/element/service?filter=</li>
<li>Find the &ldquo;id&rdquo; property for the Salesforce Service.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at how we&rsquo;d configure the binding - here&rsquo;s an example here:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  "bindings": [
    {
      "developerName": "Salesforce.com Model Summary Binding",
      "developerSummary": "The binding to show a summary of grouped assets filtered by date range.",

          "typeElementPropertyId": "&lt;the id of the Model Replica property&gt;",
        },
        {
          "databaseFieldName": "expr1",
          "typeElementPropertyId": "&lt;the id of the Asset Type property&gt;",
        },
        {
          "databaseFieldName": "expr2",
          "typeElementPropertyId": "&lt;the id of the Name property&gt;",
        },
        {
          "databaseFieldName": "expr3",
          "typeElementPropertyId": "&lt;the id of the Count property&gt;",
        },
        {
          "databaseFieldName": "expr4",
          "typeElementPropertyId": "&lt;the id of the Image property&gt;",
        }
      ],
    }
  ]

<h3 id="write-a-custom-service-in-apex">Write a custom Service in Apex</h3>

<p>In this recipe, we show you how to write a new Service using Salesforce Apex. Why would you need to write code?</p>

<ul>
<li>The logic is just too complex or it&rsquo;s more appropriate for a developer to manage the logic.</li>
<li>You want to leverage some existing code within your Flow. </li>
<li>You want Salesforce to perform a complex multi-object query.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is certainly not an exhaustive list as all projects vary. However, there can be situations where you need to enlist the support of your friendly neighborhood Apex developer.</p>

<h4 id="create-the-common-manywho-api-objects">Create the Common ManyWho API objects</h4>

<p>We do not yet have a fully comprehensive set of our API objects in Salesforce Apex, however, we have many of the main ones. In order to make these objects available to you in your Salesforce org, download the SDK file here:</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxOahH5Z4tUTX2NBcjY3aGlFLTg/view?usp=sharing">ManyWho Apex API</a></p>

<p>To add this to your org, simply do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to Salesforce (https://login.salesforce.com).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Setup</strong> and find the <em>Build</em> section in the setup tree.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Develop -&gt; Apex Classes</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New</strong> button.</li>
<li>Copy the contents of the above file into the <strong>Apex Class</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. You can now code up a Service directly in Apex. Let&rsquo;s do that now.</p>

<h4 id="tell-manywho-what-the-service-does">Tell ManyWho what the Service does</h4>

<p>In order for Flow builders to leverage the Service, you need to provide a &ldquo;describe&rdquo; API endpoint. This informs the ManyWho platform as to what the Service can do - i.e. what functions it exposes for the Flow builder to leverage. Here&rsquo;s an example Apex class that describes a very basic call with a single input and single output:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>@RestResource(urlMapping='/something/metadata')
global class SomethingDescribe {

    public static final String INPUT_MY_INPUT = 'An Input';
    public static final String OUTPUT_MY_OUTPUT = 'An Output';

    @HttpPost
    global static void doPost() {
        ManyWhoAPI.DescribeServiceActionResponseAPI describeServiceActionResponseAPI = null;
        ManyWhoAPI.DescribeServiceResponseAPI describeServiceResponseAPI = null;
        JSONGenerator jsonGenerator = null;

        // Create the describe response
        describeServiceResponseAPI = new ManyWhoAPI.DescribeServiceResponseAPI();
        describeServiceResponseAPI.actions = new List&lt;ManyWhoAPI.DescribeServiceActionResponseAPI&gt;();

        // Add a couple of configuration values that this service needs to function for all requests               
        describeServiceResponseAPI.configurationValues = new List&lt;ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI&gt;();
        describeServiceResponseAPI.configurationValues.add(new ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI('Hello', ManyWhoAPI.CONTENT_TYPE_STRING, true));
        describeServiceResponseAPI.configurationValues.add(new ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI('World', ManyWhoAPI.CONTENT_TYPE_STRING, true));

        // Create an action that authors and users can leverage
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI = new ManyWhoAPI.DescribeServiceActionResponseAPI();
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.uriPart = 'dosomething';
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.developerName = 'Do Something';
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.developerSummary = 'Does something really cool';
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.serviceInputs = new List&lt;ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI&gt;();
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.serviceInputs.add(new ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI(INPUT_MY_INPUT, ManyWhoAPI.CONTENT_TYPE_STRING, true));
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.serviceOutputs = new List&lt;ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI&gt;();
        describeServiceActionResponseAPI.serviceOutputs.add(new ManyWhoAPI.DescribeValueAPI(OUTPUT_MY_OUTPUT, ManyWhoAPI.CONTENT_TYPE_STRING, false));

        // Add the action to the describe
        describeServiceResponseAPI.actions = new List&lt;ManyWhoAPI.DescribeServiceActionResponseAPI&gt;();
        describeServiceResponseAPI.actions.add(describeServiceActionResponseAPI);

        // Tell ManyWho that this service provides logic only
        describeServiceResponseAPI.providesLogic = true;

        jsonGenerator = JSON.createGenerator(false);
        jsonGenerator.writeObject(describeServiceResponseAPI);

        // Return the describe to the caller
        RestContext.response.addHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        RestContext.response.responseBody = Blob.valueOf(jsonGenerator.getAsString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note a few things about the above code:</p>

<ul>
<li>The root URL for your Service is /something and the describe endpoint is identified with the /metadata extension as per the RestResource attribute.</li>
<li>The developerName constants are important as they&rsquo;ll be needed for the implementation of this Service. The describe API simply tells ManyWho &ldquo;what&rdquo; this Service does - it is not the actual implementation.</li>
<li>The interface is provided as inputs/outputs which can also include List and Object types. This example simply shows &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; types for simplicity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="create-the-code-that-actually-does-the-work">Create the code that actually does the work</h4>

<p>In order for Flow users to leverage the Service, you need to provide an &ldquo;invoke&rdquo; API endpoint. This actually performs the operation at runtime - i.e. it&rsquo;s the actual implementation of what was described above. Here&rsquo;s an example Apex class that invokes a very basic call with a single input and single output (as per the &ldquo;describe&rdquo; above):</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>@RestResource(urlMapping='/something/dosomething')
global class SomethingInvokeDoSomething {
    @HttpPost
    global static void doPost() {
        ManyWhoAPI.ServiceResponseAPI serviceResponseAPI = null;
        ManyWhoAPI.ServiceRequestAPI serviceRequestAPI = null;
        JSONGenerator jsonGenerator = null;
        JSONParser jsonParser = null;
        String inputValue = null;
        // Get the JSON body in the request
        jsonParser = JSON.createParser(RestContext.request.requestBody.toString());
        // Parse out the service request object
        serviceRequestAPI = (ManyWhoAPI.ServiceRequestAPI)jsonParser.readValueAs(ManyWhoAPI.ServiceRequestAPI.class);
        // The user value passed into this invoke call
        inputValue = ManyWhoAPI.getContentValue(serviceRequestAPI.inputs, SomethingDescribe.INPUT_MY_INPUT, true);

        // Do something interesting here...

        // Create the response to send back to ManyWho
        serviceResponseAPI = new ManyWhoAPI.ServiceResponseAPI();
        serviceResponseAPI.token = serviceRequestAPI.token;
        serviceResponseAPI.tenantId = serviceRequestAPI.tenantId;
        serviceResponseAPI.invokeType = ManyWhoAPI.INVOKE_TYPE_FORWARD;
        serviceResponseAPI.outputs = new List&lt;ManyWhoAPI.EngineValueAPI&gt;();
        serviceResponseAPI.outputs.add(new ManyWhoAPI.EngineValueAPI(SomethingDescribe.OUTPUT_MY_OUTPUT, ManyWhoAPI.CONTENT_TYPE_STRING, 'World!!'));
        // Generate the service response json
        jsonGenerator = JSON.createGenerator(false);
        jsonGenerator.writeObject(serviceResponseAPI);

        // Return the describe to the caller
        RestContext.response.addHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        RestContext.response.responseBody = Blob.valueOf(jsonGenerator.getAsString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note a few things about the above code:</p>

<ul>
<li>The RestResource attribute matches the root URL for the Service, plus the uriPart property provided in your describe. This class will handle the implementation for the &#39;dosomething&rsquo;.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve used the constants in the describe class to make sure the developerName properties match. If these are changed you can also break running users.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="create-a-public-site-to-host-your-api">Create a Public Site to host your API</h4>

<p>If you already have a Public Site, you don&rsquo;t need to do these steps again (assuming you want to re-use the public site):</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to Salesforce (https://login.salesforce.com).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Setup</strong> and find the <em>Build</em> section in the setup tree.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Develop -&gt; Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New</strong> button.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name for the <strong>Site Label</strong>. The <strong>Site Name</strong> should populate correctly based on that label.</li>
<li>Do not provide a <strong>Default Web Address</strong>.</li>
<li>For the <strong>Active Site Home Page</strong>, select UnderConstruction for now.</li>
<li>Tick the <strong>Require Secure Connections (HTTPS)</strong> checkbox.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
<li>You will be prompted to provide a subdomain for your site.</li>
<li>Enter a memorable name and click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
<li>On the <em>Sites</em> page, find your site listed and click on the <strong>Activate</strong> link.</li>
<li>For the same site, click on the <em>Site Label</em> for your site. Make a note of the <em>Site URL</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Public Access Settings</strong> button.</li>
<li>Scroll down the page to the <em>Enabled Apex Class Access</em> section.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button for that section.</li>
<li>Click on each of the classes you created for your Service and <strong>Add</strong> them to the list of <strong>Enabled Apex Classes</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those steps will have created a public site at the address provided for the Site URL noted in step 13. Your Service will be available at:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>https://&lt;your subdomain&gt;-developer-edition.&lt;your pod&gt;.force.com/services/apexrest/&lt;your root service address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To test the Service is configured correctly, you can use one of many available tools to send a JSON POST request to the service. Try sending the following JSON in the post to check the basic service is available:</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>
<code class="prettyprint">
POST https://&lt;your subdomain&gt;-developer-edition.&lt;your pod&gt;.force.com/services/apexrest/&lt;your root service address&gt;/&lt;your uri part for the service&gt;
</code>
<code class="prettyprint">json
{
  &quot;joinPlayerUri&quot;:&quot;Hello&quot;,
  &quot;playerUri&quot;:&quot;World&quot;,
  &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;http://manywho.com&quot;
}
</code></p>

<p>Assuming that returns a JSON response with no errors, you should be able to now install the Service in ManyWho.</p>

<h4 id="installing-your-service-in-manywho">Installing your Service in ManyWho</h4>

<ol>
<li>Login to the draw tool using your authoring credentials.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Services</strong> option in the menu bar.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Create New</strong> button.</li>
<li>Provide a memorable name for <strong>Name</strong>.</li>
<li>For the <strong>Service URL</strong>, provide your root Service address (without the &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; or &ldquo;uriPart&rdquo; at the end).</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to enter in additional configuration settings and finish as usual.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the Twilio Service to build Flows that do interesting things with text messaging, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. For more information on Twilio, you can visit their site here: <a href="https://twilio.com">https://twilio.com</a>. It can also be helpful to reference the Twilio developer documentation (<a href="https://docs.twilio.com">https://docs.twilio.com</a>) if you need additional information on how things work.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-twilio-service">Installing the Twilio Service</h3>

<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>

<p>In order to install the Twilio Service, you first need an active Twilio Account. To sign up for an account, please go here: <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio">https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have an account, you can complete the Twilio Service installation below. All of the information you need is available in the <strong>Account</strong> area under the <strong>API Credentials</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Text Messaging</strong></p>

<p>If you are going to use the Service to send/receive text messages, you should do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Purchase a number that supports text messaging.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>PROGRAMMABLE SMS</strong> section, click on <strong>PHONE NUMBERS</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the purchased phone number and view the <strong>Messaging</strong> tab. Provide the following:

<ul>
<li><strong>Configure with</strong>: select <em>URL</em></li>
<li><strong>Request URL</strong>: <code class="prettyprint">https://services.manywho.com/api/twilio/2/callback/status/message</code></li>
<li><strong>Fallback URL</strong>: <code class="prettyprint">https://services.manywho.com/api/twilio/2/callback/status/message</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This will configure the number for asynchronous text messaging. Allowing your Flows to not only send texts, but also receive and process responses.</p>

<p><strong>Text-to-Speech</strong></p>

<p>If you are going to use the Service to build IVRs using text-to-speech, you should do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Purchase a number that supports voice. You can re-use the number above.</li>
<li>Build a Flow that will be used to handle in-coming calls from your Twilio number.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>PROGRAMMABLE VOICE</strong> section, click on <strong>PHONE NUMBERS</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the purchased phone number and view the <strong>Voice</strong> tab. Provide the following:

<ul>
<li><strong>Configure with</strong>: select <em>URL</em></li>
<li><strong>Request URL</strong>: <code class="prettyprint">https://services.manywho.com/api/twilio/2/callback/twiml/voice/flow/{tenantId}/{flowId}</code></li>
<li><strong>Fallback URL</strong>: <code class="prettyprint">https://services.manywho.com/api/twilio/2/callback/twiml/voice/flow/{tenantId}/{flowId}</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="building-an-ivr">Building an IVR</h3>

<p>You can use the Twilio Service to create Flows that work exactly like an IVR. A few considerations:</p>

<ol>
<li>You should use Steps for the content of each step in the IVR. Do not use any formatting as this can confuse the text-to-speech converter.</li>
<li>Any outcomes coming from the Step should have a Name that&rsquo;s a digit. If the user enters the digit into their phone, this is equivalent to a user clicking on the Outcome in the browser.</li>
<li>The Flow should be &ldquo;public&rdquo; as Twilio does not support any form of authentication.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can always test your Flow in the browser before accessing it via Twilio.</p>

          <h1 id="reporting">Reporting</h1>

<p>States can be set to send reporting data to an external endpoint that adheres to our Reporting API interface (a supported implementation is available <a href="https://github.com/manywho/reporting">on GitHub</a>). This allows you to gain a greater insight into how and when flows are being uses, as well as the values being used inside a state.</p>

<aside class="notice">Reporting only works with <strong>Permanent States</strong></aside>

<h3 id="setting-your-endpoint">Setting your Endpoint</h3>

<p>The endpoint for reporting can be set in the Draw Tool, under <strong>Tenant -&gt; Reporting -&gt; URI</strong>. The endpoint must adhere to our Reporting API interface.</p>

<p>Inside your player, set <code class="prettyprint">manywho[&quot;options&quot;][&quot;reportingMode&quot;]</code> to one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PATH</strong> - report only the information in the State that pertains to the path the user/users took through the Flow, including location information if provided</li>
<li><strong>PATH_AND_VALUES</strong> - report both <strong><em>PATH</em></strong> and <strong><em>VALUES</em></strong> information</li>
<li><strong>VALUES</strong> - report only the Values collected in the State as the user went through the Flow</li>

<p><em>Create new Tenants and provision the first Flow Builder in a single request</em></p>

<p>When you provision a new tenant in ManyWho, there are a few things you need to be aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the email and username are the same, the Platform will provision the Tenant as a Domain Tenant. This means that additional Flow Builders can only be provisioned into this Tenant if they have the same email domain (e.g. @mycompany.com). In addition, the default permissions of the Tenant will allow any other Flow Builders from that same email domain to provision themselves, or self provision, into your Domain Tenant without permission from you. They are part of your email domain and therefore we do not impose restrictions on them gaining access independently.</li>
<li>If the email is different from the username, the username must follow the format: @{tenant name}.manywho.com (as shown in the example to the right). Using this format allows Flow Builders with the same email address to provision as many tenants as they like - as long as the {tenant name} is unique. In addition, the default permissions of the Tenant will not allow further Flow Builders to self provision. Any additional Flow Builders must be added by the first Flow builder that provisioned the Tenant or other Flow Builders that have an active account in that Tenant.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a tenant is provisioned, the Flow builder provisioning options can be changed. Please have a look at the Tenant API in this documentation for details. Further to this, each Tenant can have any number of sub-Tenants. The benefit of sub-Tenants is that a Flow builder can move between Tenants more easily using single sign-on. Please have a look at the Sub-Tenant API in this documentation for details.</p>

<p>If the type Tenant User Registration Settings (in the Tenant API) is set to MANUAL or SPECIFIC, this API will only work with a valid Flow builder Authorization header.</p>

<h3 id="resetting-a-flow-builder-password">Resetting a Flow Builder Password</h3>

<p>The password reset API is only applicable to Flow Builders. For running users, the user identity is managed by the underlying Service (e.g. Salesforce, Box, Google), and therefore user resets should be performed on the underlying system, not within ManyWho. The password reset API requires two separate API calls to complete. The first API call sends the user the password reset notification. The second API call performs the actual password change, based on the token provided in the notification.</p>

<p><em>The Tenant provides a central place for Flow Builders to build, manage and deploy Flows.</em></p>

<p>Once a Tenant has been provisioned, there are various settings available to ensure security is correctly configured and data is properly managed for reporting purposes. The APIs below work for both Tenants and sub-Tenants. The only difference between a Tenant and and sub-Tenant is that Flow Builders can move between them using single sign-on and the Tenants are grouped together to ease management.</p>

<b>Careful!</b><br/>
Use this API with extreme caution. Though we do keep backups of Tenant data, recovering from Tenant delete operations takes time and is chargeable. A request to delete Tenant data does require verification via email before the actual delete is performed. However, make sure you check your settings carefully as dependency validations are ignored.

<p><em>The User object provides basic information about Flow Builders and running users for the Tenant.</em></p>

<p>Users on the Platform are identified via their email. As a result, the email address determines &ldquo;who&rdquo; the user is. The email address is the unique identifier across the entire platform. When running users access a Flow, a User is provisioned into the Tenant on-demand. In addition, Flow Builders are included in the User listing. As a single running user can login to multiple Services, a User entry will be provided for each Service being logged into. As a result, the username parameter is used to load an individual User record for a particular Service. Currently it is assumed that the username will be unique for each Service. Please contact the ManyWho team if this causes issues with User management.</p>

<p><em>The Flow State object provides data about a specific instance of a running Flow.</em></p>

<p>The Flow State provides in-depth information about how Users have interacted with the Flow, from the data that has been collected in Values, to the path of Map Elements that were travelled, to the users who have interacted with the Flow at the various stages of its execution. This Flow State data is only available for active Flows that have not yet completed. This API should also not be used for reporting purposes as we have a separate reporting API and reporting infrastructure.</p>

<p><em>The Flow object represents an entire Flow application.</em></p>

<p>Flows represent an atomic package of Elements that when run are fully versioned. Flows can reference other Flows using a Flow Out or messaging other Flows in the Tenant using the Runtime Service. When referencing Flows (parent or sub-Flows), the Platform will always take the latest activated and default version of the Flow.</p>

<p>When editing Elements in a Flow, you do not do this through the Flow part of the APIs. Each Element has its own API endpoint for managing objects, importing into the Flow, etc.</p>

<p>As with Group Elements, a Flow can also have permissions. However, unlike the Group Element, if a user cannot authenticate to a Flow, they cannot access any part of the Flow State. Effectively, the Flow authorization protects your Flow application from any access by running users that cannot successfully authenticate given the provided authorization criteria. Therefore any Group Elements act as a sub-set of authorization. The running users must first authenticate successfully into the Flow and subsequently authenticate into any Group Elements.  Further to this, there&rsquo;s no requirement that the Flow and Group Elements use the same Service Element for authentication. Flow Builders can build Flows that authenticate across multiple systems, move from unauthenticated to authenticated access, etc.</p>

<p><em>The Flow Graph object provides the coordinate and basic configuration information of Map and Group Elements.</em></p>

<p>The Flow Graph object is typically used for editing the layout of the Flow for Flow Builders. This API should not be used for creating new Flows, but rather to manage Map and Group Elements in an existing Flow. The focus of this API is to allow Flow Builders to make coordinate changes to these Elements while ensuring other Flow Builders are notified of these changes and can be updated in realtime.</p>

          <h2 id="flow-snapshot">Flow SnapShot</h2>

<p><em>The Flow SnapShot object is the package that is sent to the Platform runtime engine.</em></p>

<p>Without a Flow SnapShot, a Flow cannot be accessed by running users. The Flow SnapShot contains all, fully versioned, Elements that are needed for the Flow to execute (excluding sub-Flows). In the Draw Tool, each time a Flow is run or published, a Flow SnapShot is taken. This means you then have a version of the Flow that can also be reverted if Flow Builders make a range of mistakes and would like to go back to a previous SnapShot.</p>

<p>The Flow SnapShot also acts as a version system as all metadata for the Flow can be accessed and external tools can be used to &lsquo;diff&rsquo; for changes. Equally, for compliance, a customer can access the Flow SnapShots to get a complete picture of which Flow the running user(s) were running at any particular point in time.</p>

<p><em>The Group Element object represents any group or Element in your Flow diagram that can contain Map Elements.</em></p>

<p>Group Elements are used to add additional behavior to Map Elements in your Flow. The Group Element currently only supports the ability to change the authentication context of the Map Elements it contains. This allows builders to change the permissions for Map Elements contained in the Group Element and restrict the ability for running users to edit or take action on any Outcomes. The properties of the Group Element are outlined here.</p>

<aside class="notice">
<b>SWIMLANES</b><br/>It&rsquo;s important to note that the Swimlane Group Element assigns a new authorization context to the Map Elements it holds. This authorization context is passed up the stack to any integrated Services that can leverage this information to provide additional features. For example, the Salesforce Service uses the Swimlane information to determine the percentage of running users that have voted. It also uses this context to determine who should be notified or emailed.

<p><em>The Map Element object represents any node or Element in your Flow diagram.</em></p>

<p>Map Elements are used to set out the actions and journey of your Flow. Each Map Element performs an action - which may be to present the user with information, collect information, or perform logical actions such as inserting records into a database, executing business rules, or sending messages to a 3rd party application. There&rsquo;s a lot of functionality packed into Map Elements, and that has been separated out in the sections below. The base properties of the Map Element are outlined here.</p>

<h4 id="map-element">Map Element</h4>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>id</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>A unique identifier field assigned by the platform. This value should not be included for new Map Elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>elementType</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>A unique element type for the Map Element. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>START</strong>: Start Element.</li><li><strong>STEP</strong>: Step Element.</li><li><strong>INPUT</strong>: Page Element.</li><li><strong>DECISION</strong>: Decision Element.</li><li><strong>OPERATOR</strong>: Operator Element.</li><li><strong>MESSAGE</strong>: Message Element.</li><li><strong>DATABASE_SAVE</strong>: Database Save Element.</li><li><strong>DATABASE_LOAD</strong>: Database Load Element.</li><li><strong>DATABASE_DELETE</strong>: Database Delete Element.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>developerName</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The name for the Map Element. This is typically a helpful name to remind builders of the purpose of the Map Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>developerSummary</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The summary for the Map Element. This is typically additional information that will help explain the purpose of the Map Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>x</strong><br/>integer</td>
<td>The X coordinate of the Map Element in the Flow diagram. If the Map Element is contained inside a Group Element, this the X coordinate in relation to the Group Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>y</strong><br/>integer</td>
<td>The Y coordinate of the Map Element in the Flow diagram. If the Map Element is contained inside a Group Element, this the Y coordinate in relation to the Group Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>groupElementId</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the Group Element that holds this Map Element. This identifier is only required for Map Elements that are in a Group Element. E.g. if a Map Element is in a Swimlane, this will be the unique identifier of the Swimlane Group Element that is in charge of restricting access to this step in the Flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>pageElementId</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the Page Element that is associated with this Map Element. This identifier is only required for Map Elements that will render a Page Layout. E.g. if a Map Element is a Page, this will be the unique identifier of the Page Layout that should be shown to the user at this step in the Flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>clearNavigationOverrides</strong><br/>boolean</td>
<td>If any Navigation Overrides have been applied to the Navigation of the running Flow, this step should clear all of the overrides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>postUpdateToStream</strong><br/>boolean</td>
<td>If the Flow is associated with a Stream (E.g. a social feed in Chatter), this boolean indicates that the Map Element should automatically post to the stream when reached.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>postUpdateWhenType</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>If the postUpdateToStream key is set to true, this value tells the platform when to perform the actual update. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>ON_LOAD</strong>: Post the update to the stream when the Map Element loads.</li><li><strong>ON_EXIT</strong>: Post the update to the stream when the Map Element is finished (i.e. by clicking on an Outcome that moves the Flow to the next step).</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>postUpdateMessage</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>If the postUpdateToStream key is set to true, this is the content of the message that will be posted to the stream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>statusMessage</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>If the Flow is currently in a &ldquo;WAIT&rdquo; state as a result of a Message Action, this is the message that will be shown to the users while waiting. The status message can be overwritten by the Service at runtime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>notAuthorizedMessage</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>If the running user(s) of the Flow does not have access to a particular section of the Flow (E.g. due to a Swimlane), this is the message that will be shown to the users who are not authorized to view the content or take action on a Map Element step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>userContent</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The content that should be displayed to the running user(s) of the Flow. This key is only used for Step Map Elements and is a quick way of building out content in a Flow without needing to build a Page Layout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>updateByName</strong><br/>boolean</td>
<td>When working with Map Element objects through the modeling API, this setting should be set to true if you do not have a unique identifier for a Map Element but wish to update any Map Element in the system that has this same name. This key is typically only used when scripting updates to Flows as part of a migration tool.</td>

<p>A Data Action is used to perform create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) type operations on a Service. There are a number of features that make data actions particularly powerful:</p>

<ol>
<li>You do not need to manage INSERT vs UPDATE operations. We automatically track the objects in your Flow and know if it is a new object to be inserted or an update to an existing object. This is done using our &ldquo;SAVE&rdquo; operation. We do not separate INSERT and UPDATE.</li>
<li>You can configure filters using our common metadata. This means you do not need to understand the query language of the underlying Service, you can create queries using a standard notation and we automatically translate this notation into SQL (RDBMS), SOQL (Salesforce), ZOQL (Zuora), etc.</li>
<li>The Data Action automatically knows where the data needs to go. There is no need to map fields into the database as this is already configured in the Type. In addition, a number of Services also support &ldquo;smart save&rdquo; which does a smart merge of data collected/changed in the Flow with data already stored in the Service.</li>
<li>If you need advanced data management capabilities such as summary roll-ups or joined tables, you can configure this using &ldquo;commands&rdquo; (as supported by the underlying Service implementation).</li>
</ol>

<p>A Listener is used to listen to events on Objects stored or managed by a Service. When an event occurs (e.g. a record is updated) in the underlying application (e.g. Salesforce), the platform will trigger the executing Flow of the event so it can take appropriate action.</p>

<p>Listeners work as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>You send the Service the Objects you want to listen to (referencing the appropriate Value). In addition, you specify the type of event you&rsquo;re interested in (e.g. record created).</li>
<li>The Service will notify the platform when that event has happened on the associated Object(s). This will populate the referenced Value with the latest data from the Service.</li>
<li>You specify the Outcomes (with Comparisons/Rules) under which you &ldquo;accept&rdquo; the event and the path the Flow should follow. If those Comparisons/Rules are met, the Flow will proceed to the next MapElement in the Flow as defined by the matching Outcome. If not, the Flow will continue to wait until the appropriate event occurs.</li>

<p>A Message Action is used to perform general API operations on a Service. There are a number of features that make Message Actions particularly powerful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple inputs/multiple outputs</strong>: When executing a Message Action, the Service can specify multiple inputs and multiple outputs post processing. E.g. you might have a Service that moves a file from one folder to another (in Box.com). For this you&rsquo;d specify the file that needs to be moved and the location you&rsquo;d like to move it from and to (these would be the inputs). The outputs might be the file with revised information regarding its location and permissions.</li>
<li><strong>They can &ldquo;wait&rdquo;</strong>: When executing a Message Action, it can sometimes take some time to complete the request. Alternatively, the request may need to wait for a response. E.g. if you are sending a text message via Twilio.com and you want to have the Flow wait for the response before proceeding. Other Services may be used precisely to cause the Flow to wait, e.g. our Timer Service that allows you to stop or wait the flow for a timer interval or until a specific date. A &ldquo;wait&rdquo; can be created by building Comparison/Rules (e.g. the rules under which the Flow will proceed down a particular path). The Flow will only follow an Outcome until the Rules are satisfied.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Message Actions are described in the Service definition. The purpose of the Message Actions is to map Values in the Flow to the inputs and outputs specified by the Service.</p>

<p>A Navigation Override is used to alter the functionality of Navigation in your Flow. As running users go through a Flow, it is often useful to alter how the Navigation works. As a result, when the user gets to a particular Map Element, you can execute changes to the Navigation. These changes will persist until altered by another Map Element. This can be useful in a variety of use-cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Certain parts of the Navigation should only be functional once a certain portion of the Flow has been completed. You can either disable or only make visible these parts of the Navigation when ready. For example, you might want to disable Navigation steps 3-5 until step 2 in your Flow has been completed.</li>
<li>You want the Navigation to remember where the user was in a particular section of your Flow. For example, the user might be going through a sequence of diagnostic steps under a &ldquo;Diagnose&rdquo; Navigation Item. If the user then clicks on an &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo; navigation item to answer a quick question, by default when they click back on &ldquo;Diagnose&rdquo; it will restart the diagnostic section. If each Map Element in the &ldquo;Diagnose&rdquo; section overrides the navigation to point to that particular Map Element, when the user clicks on the &ldquo;Diagnose&rdquo; navigation item, it will take them to that particular Map Element, not back to the start.</li>

<p>An Operation is used to make a change to a Value or execute a Macro in your Flow. Each Operation can be ordered allowing builders to do Operations in a particular sequence - as individual commands performed on Values. Here are some examples of Operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to assign the content of a Value so the user doesn&rsquo;t need to do it manually.</li>
<li>You want to get the next Object from a List of Objects in your Flow.</li>
<li>You want to execute a Macro that performs complex logic and business rules on Values in your Flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>In mathematics, an Operation would be something like: x = 3</p>

<p>An Outcome is used to make move the running user(s) from one Map Element in the Flow to another or from one Map Element into another Flow. An outcome can represent a button the running user(s) can click, or it can represent a path the executing Flow should follow based on logical operations in the Flow. Outcomes can be combined with business rules (provided by Comparison/Rules) to determine the path of execution based on pre-determined logic.</p>

<aside class="notice">
<b>Outcomes Support</b><br/>
All Map Elements support Outcomes. Map Elements that support Outcomes with Comparison/Rules are:
<ul>
<li>Page</li>
<li>Decision</li>
<li>Message</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<aside class="success">
<b>Pages, Decisions, and Messages</b><br/>
When using outcomes with Comparison/Rules, it&rsquo;s important to note a few things:
<ul>
<li><b>Decision</b>: The Outcomes are evaluated in real-time and an Outcome path is always selected or the Flow completes. Decisions do not have the ability to &ldquo;wait&rdquo;, they are processed and the correct Outcome path is selected. If none of the Outcome Comparison/Rules evaluate to true, the Flow finishes.</li>
<li><b>Message</b>: The Outcomes are evaluated in real-time every time the Service responds with a status update. As a result, the Flow will continue to &ldquo;wait&rdquo; until one of the Outcome Comparision/Rules evaluates to true. A Flow can &ldquo;wait&rdquo; for as long as the State exists on the platform.</li>
<li><b>Page</b>: The Page effectively extends Message. As a result, Outcomes that have a blank &ldquo;label&rdquo; key can be used with Outcomes running users can click/select. For example, you may have a Page used for approving some data. The Page could also execute a Message Action with the Timer Service to &ldquo;wait&rdquo; 2 hours. If he Message Action returns before the running user(s) take action, the Flow will progress down the Outcome path configured to proceed when the Timer Service responds. This is useful for escalation use-cases.</li>

<p>The Vote object is used to configure voting or multi-user approval options on an Outcome. By configuring the Vote, you can determine if a set number of running users or a percentage of running users (within the authentication context of the Map Element) must click on a particular Outcome before the Flow will proceed down that path. For example, before the approval is accepted, more than two running users must click on the &ldquo;Approve&rdquo; outcome before the Flow will progress. A few details about this feature:</p>

<p>The implementation of the Vote algorithm is determined by the Service. Builders should refer to the documentation of the Service being used.
The first running user to click on an Outcome contained in a voting Map Element will force the platform to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; the Page from any further user inputs. Effectively the Map Element becomes read-only until the Vote is completed.</p>

<p><em>The Navigation Element object provides a menu or navigation structure allowing users to move around your Flow application in an unstructured way.</em></p>

<p>Navigation Elements are used to set out the structure and Map Element locations which users can jump to directly. As a result, your Map Elements act more like web pages on a website than steps in a process. The base properties of the Navigation Element are outlined here.</p>

<p><em>The Page Element object provides the structure of your pages or screens.</em></p>

<p>The purpose of the Page Element is to allow Flow builders to lay out the structure of the pages the users will interact with as part of the Flow application. The Page Element is extremely extensible and allows developers to create their own Components and Containers as needed to give users the best possible experience using your Flow application. The base properties of the Page Element are outlined here.</p>

<p>A Page Container is used to determine the scaffolding of your Page. Page Containers allow Flow builders to set out the relative position of Page Components on the Page. In comparison with HTML5, a Page Container would be equivalent to a &lsquo;div&rsquo; tag. As a result, Page Containers do not have any value or input, they are simply used to determine the layout or scaffolding aspects of the Page.</p>

<p>The type of Page Container is determined by the containerType property and developers looking to build custom Containers should use a unique containerType name to identify their Container implementation. The properties outlined below are the common attributes for typical Containers, however, if these do not suffice, developers should use the &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; to extend the attributes for their own specific needs. It&rsquo;s important to note that each of the properties below provides features and the engine does not have any understanding of one container type from another.</p>

<p>A Page Component is used to show or edit information on your Page. In comparison with HTML5, a Page Component would be equivalent to an &#39;input&rsquo;, &#39;textarea&rsquo;, or similar tag. As a result, Page Components typically do have a value or input, and are used to prompt the user for some form or input or to view a particular piece of information on the Page.</p>

<p>The type of Page Component is determined by the componentType property and developers looking to build custom Components should use a unique componentType name to identify their Component implementation. The properties outlined below are the common attributes for typical Components, however, if these do not suffice, developers should use the &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; to extend the attributes for their own specific needs. It&rsquo;s important to note that each of the properties below provides features and the engine does not have any understanding of one component type from another.</p>

<p>Page Conditions are used to make your Pages dynamic. Based on a set of Page Rules, the Page Conditions can assign values to your Page Components but also change various properties on your Page Components and Containers such as: required, editable, visible. Page Components can also have data refreshed and objectDataRequest information dynamically assigned so you can, for example, change TABLE filters. This gives Flow builders the ability to provide single Pages that can provide the running user(s) with a very dynamic experience.</p>

<p><em>The Tag Element object provides additional runtime data to your Page Element Containers/Components and Navigation Elements/Items.</em></p>

<p>The purpose of the Tag Element is to add flexibility to your Flow application user experience. The components, containers and navigation items in your Flow can benefit from having access to the Flow State to get more contextual information. For example, if you have a numeric input field, it may be useful to know the possible range or numeric values that can be provided by the end user - where that range depends on logic in the Flow. The components, containers and navigation items also supports &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; and these are often sufficient for many use-cases. As a result, only use the Tag Element if you need information that is very specific to the Flow State for particular running user(s). The base properties of the Tag Element are outlined here.</p>

<p><em>The Value Element object stores data collected in the Flow State.</em></p>

<p>The purpose of the Value Element is to allow Flow builders to determine how data collected from running user(s) or external Services will be stored and used. The Value Element represents the memory for the Flow application so data gathered can be later saved, updated, or viewed. The base properties of the Value Element are outlined here.</p>

<h4 id="value-element">Value Element</h4>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>id</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>A unique identifier field assigned by the platform. This value should not be included for new Value Elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>elementType</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>A unique element type for the Value Element. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>VARIABLE</strong>: Value Element</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>developerName</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The name for the Value Element. This is typically a helpful name to remind builders of the purpose of the Value Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>developerSummary</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The summary for the Value Element. This is typically additional information that will help explain the purpose of the Value Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>isFixed</strong><br/>boolean</td>
<td>Indicates if the value stored in the Value Element can be changed in the Flow State. If this is set to true, the Value Element acts like a &lsquo;constant&rsquo;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>access</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The external access of this Value Element. A Flow is a bit like a code function or method. When called, data can be passed into the Flow State and when the Flow &ldquo;finishes&rdquo;, data can be passed out of the Flow State. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>INPUT</strong>: The value for this Value Element can be assigned when the Flow is initialized (started).</li><li><strong>INPUT_OUTPUT</strong>: The value for this Value Element can be assigned when the Flow is initialized (started) and the value will be returned with the Flow is finalized (finished).</li><li><strong>OUTPUT</strong>: The value will be returned when the Flow is finalized (finished).</li><li><strong>PRIVATE</strong>: The value for this Value Element can only be changed as per the configuration of the Flow builder (e.g. through Pages/Page Layouts, Operators, etc).</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>contentType</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The content type represented by the Value Element. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>ContentString</strong>: A string value</li><li><strong>ContentNumber</strong>: A numeric value</li><li><strong>ContentPassword</strong>: A hidden value</li><li><strong>ContentDateTime</strong>: A date and time value</li><li><strong>ContentContent</strong>: A rich content value</li><li><strong>ContentObject</strong>: An object value</li><li><strong>ContentList</strong>: A list value</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>contentFormat</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The formatting that should be applied to the value in this Value Element. This property does not apply for Values Elements with a contentType of ContentObject or ContentList. For Typed objects, the contentFormat is set for each Property in the Type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>defaultContentValue</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The default value for this Value Element. This is only needed if the contentType property is set to ContentObject or ContentList.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>defaultObjectData</strong><br/>array</td>
<td>The default object data for this Value Element. This is only needed if the contentType property is set to ContentObject or ContentList.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>initializationOperations</strong><br/>array</td>
<td>(Deprecated)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>typeElementId</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The Type of the Object or List value being provided. This is only needed if the contentType property is set to ContentObject or ContentList.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>updateByName</strong><br/>boolean</td>
<td>When working with Value Element objects through the modeling API, this setting should be set to true if you do not have a unique identifier for a Value Element but wish to update any Value Element in the system that has this same name. This key is typically only used when scripting updates to Flows as part of a migration tool.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>id</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>A unique identifier field assigned by the platform. This value should not be included for new Value Elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>elementType</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>A unique element type for the Value Element. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>VARIABLE</strong>: Value Element</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>developerName</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The name for the Value Element. This is typically a helpful name to remind builders of the purpose of the Value Element.</td>

<td>The external access of this Value Element. A Flow is a bit like a code function or method. When called, data can be passed into the Flow State and when the Flow &ldquo;finishes&rdquo;, data can be passed out of the Flow State. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>INPUT</strong>: The value for this Value Element can be assigned when the Flow is initialized (started).</li><li><strong>INPUT_OUTPUT</strong>: The value for this Value Element can be assigned when the Flow is initialized (started) and the value will be returned with the Flow is finalized (finished).</li><li><strong>OUTPUT</strong>: The value will be returned when the Flow is finalized (finished).</li><li><strong>PRIVATE</strong>: The value for this Value Element can only be changed as per the configuration of the Flow builder (e.g. through Pages/Page Layouts, Operators, etc).</li></ul></td>

<td>The developer name of the Type of the Object or List value being provided. This is only needed if the contentType property is set to ContentObject or ContentList.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>command</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>As part of referencing or applying an operation to a Value, it is sometimes necessary to perform a command on that Value. Supported commands are:<ul><li><strong>ADD</strong>: Adds an Object to a List Value. If the Object exists in the List, the Object is updated. If it is not already in the List, it&rsquo;s added.</li><li><strong>REMOVE</strong>: Removes an Object from a List Value.</li><li><strong>GET_FIRST</strong>: Gets the first Object from a List Value.</li><li><strong>GET_NEXT</strong>: Gets the next Object from a List Value. List Values maintain a &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; so that each time the GET_NEXT command is executed in the Flow, the List Value remembers which is the next Value.</li><li><strong>FILTER</strong>: Executes a filter on a List Value. For the FILTER command to execute correctly, additional properties must be provided.</li><li><strong>GET_LENGTH</strong>: Gets the length of a List Value.</li><li><strong>NEW</strong>: Creates a new instance of the Value.</li><li><strong>EMPTY</strong>: Sets the Value equal to nothing.</li><li><strong>DETACH</strong>: Removes the external identifier from the root Object so that it will not be &ldquo;remembered&rdquo; when updating Lists or saving back to a remote Service.</li></ul></td>

<td>For Values of Type Object or List, you can refer to specific properties. E.g. for an Object Value of Type &ldquo;Account&rdquo;, a property might be &ldquo;Name&rdquo;. If this key is null, the platform will assume you are referring to the whole Value. If this key contains a valid identifier for a property in the Type, the platform will refer to that particular property in the Object or List Value.</td>

<p><em>The Type Element object defines the structure of Objects and Lists in the Flow.</em></p>

<p>The purpose of the Type Element is to allow Flow builders to determine the business objects that will be used in the Flow. Often the Type Elements are provided when the Flow builder installs a new Service Element, however, Flow builders can define their own Type Elements as needed to support the objectives of the Flow. The Type Element also provides the bindings back to the Service Elements that can save, read or delete data of the same structure. As a result, the Type Element maps from friendly business objects to underlying storage implementations as provided by the Service Element. The base properties of the Type Element are outlined here.</p>

It also means the Service Element has control to update the Type Element as needed. If Flow builders want to manage the Type Element structure and bindings independently of a Service Element, this property should be set to null.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>properties</strong><br/>array</td>
<td>The array of Properties associated with this Type. These might be called &ldquo;columns&rdquo; or &ldquo;fields&rdquo; and represent the data that should be associated with this business object or Type Element. For example, for a Type of &ldquo;address&rdquo;, the Properties might be &ldquo;street&rdquo;, &ldquo;city&rdquo;, &ldquo;region&rdquo;, etc. Each Property entry has the following keys:<br/><br/><strong>id</strong> (string): A unique identifier field assigned by the platform. This value should not be included for new Properties.<br/><br/><strong>developerName</strong> (string): The name for the Property. This is typically a helpful name to remind builders of the purpose of the Property.<br/><br/><strong>contentType</strong> (string):The content type represented by the Value Element. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>ContentString</strong>: A string value</li><li><strong>ContentNumber</strong>: A numeric value</li><li><strong>ContentPassword</strong>: A hidden value</li><li><strong>ContentDateTime</strong>: A date and time value</li><li><strong>ContentContent</strong>: A rich content value</li><li><strong>ContentObject</strong>: An object value</li><li><strong>ContentList</strong>: A list value</li></ul><br/><strong>contentFormat</strong> (string): The formatting that should be applied to values in this Property.<br/><br/><strong>typeElementId</strong> (string): The Type of the Object or List value associated with this Property. This is only needed if the contentType property is set to ContentObject or ContentList.<br/><br/><strong>typeElementDeveloperName</strong> (string): The developerName of the Type (used when the id has not yet been assigned to the referenced Type).</td>

<td>When working with Type Element objects through the modeling API, this setting should be set to true if you do not have a unique identifier for a Type Element but wish to update any Type Element in the system that has this same name. This key is typically only used when scripting updates to Flows as part of a migration tool.</td>

<p>A Binding is used to map Properties in the Type to database fields in the Service. The mapping does not need to be directly to database tables in the Service, however, the binding should provide unique identifier information necessary for the Service Element to put the provided values back to the correct storage locations. The Binding is typically pre-configured as part of the Type installation process. However, it is possible for Flow builders to define Bindings manually.</p>

<p><em>Performing data operations on a Service.</em></p>

<p>The Object Data Request object is used in a couple of places in the platform to configure save, load, and/or delete operations on a Service. In particular, this object is used:</p>

<ul>
<li>in Data Actions as part of a Map Element, or</li>
<li>to load data into a Page/Layout component such as a table or combobox.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the Object Data Request object is to provide a standard notation for managing data, without creating strong dependencies with the underlying Service and the various approaches for handling data (e.g. SQL vs SOQL vs ZOQL, etc).</p>

<p>The base configuration of the Object Data Request object is outlined below:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>typeElementId</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the Type of data being referenced in the underlying Service. E.g. the unique identifier for the &ldquo;Account&rdquo; Type is using the Salesforce Service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>typeElementBindingId</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the specific binding that should be used for the chosen Type. Each Type can have a set of bindings which map the data in your Flow Values back to the underlying fields in the Service. E.g. an &ldquo;Account&rdquo; Type could have a binding for the Salesforce Service and also a binding for the Exact Target Service. The structure of the Type may be the same, but the data would be stored in different fields depending on the selected Service.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In addition to the above keys, the Object Data Request object also supports a &ldquo;listFilter&rdquo; key. This is used for LOAD operations when a sub-set of data is needed:</p>

<h5 id="listfilter">ListFilter</h5>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>filterId</strong><br/>object</td>
<td>The ValueElementId pointing to the Value that holds the unique identifier for a particular record. This option should only be used if you know the identifier of the record you wish to load from. This is basically a convenience option for scenarios where you do not wish to configure all of the &ldquo;where&rdquo; clauses and you know only one record will be returned. The platform will perform additional validation - e.g. if more than one record is returned the platform will throw an error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>comparisonType</strong><br/>string</td>
<td>The type of comparison that should be used when evaluating the set of &ldquo;where&rdquo; entries. Valid values are:<ul><li><strong>AND</strong>: Each &ldquo;where&rdquo; entry must be true for the object to be returned from the Service.</li><li><strong>OR</strong>: Any &ldquo;where&rdquo; entry must be true for the object to be returned from the Service.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>where</strong><br/>array</td>
<td>The array of &ldquo;where&rdquo; entries needed to perform the filter. Each Where entry has the following keys:<br/><br/><strong>columnTypeElementPropertyId</strong> (string):<br/>The unique identifier for the property in the Type that should be filtered by.

<p><em>References to Values in your Flow.</em></p>

<p>The Value Element Id object is used in many places in the configuration of your Flow. All of the data used in your Flow is stored in Values. As a result, if you need to perform any operation using data:</p>

<ul>
<li>collected from the user in a Page/Layout,</li>
<li>gathered from a Data Action, or</li>
<li>input/output from a Message Action</li>
</ul>

<p>you use the Value Element Id to tell the Flow which Value you&rsquo;re referring to. Value Element Id objects are indicated by JSON keys that start with &ldquo;valueElement&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

          <h1 id="translate-api">Translate API</h1>

<p>When building Flows on the Platform, all &ldquo;content&rdquo; is automatically separated from &ldquo;logic&rdquo;. This means that all Flows are automatically ready for internationalization into other languages. The result being that you can write one Flow, but adjust the content accordingly for each Content Value Culture needed.</p>

<p>The Translate APIs allow builders to manage content translations for all Flows and Elements.</p>

<p><em>The Content Value Culture object represents a language or brand supported by the Tenant.</em></p>

<p>Content Value Cultures are used to specify the language/brand options that are available for the Tenant. By default all Tenants have a Content Value Culture for USA (English). However, for multi-national/language use-cases, others can be specified: E.g. Country: JP, Language: JP, Variant: (none). This follows the ISO conventions for language. However, the platform also supports a fourth variation on the standard ISO properties; this is Brand. As a result, Content Value Culture objects can also be used to specify white-labelling or single language variations on Flow content. </p>

<p><em>The Flow Translation object provides all of the content Elements and properties in a Flow that can be translated.</em></p>

<p>The Flow Translation object provides every Element in the Flow that is available for translation. It therefore provides all of the content in the Flow, regardless of whether or not the Elements are shared (such as Value and Page Elements) or specific to the Flow (such as Map or Navigation Elements). The Flow Translation object also includes additional properties to help translators identify the purpose/location of the content being translated.</p>
